
// How to Approach and Solve a Problem üîç


// Understand the Problem: Clearly define the problem and identify the inputs and outputs.
// Plan the Solution: Break down the problem into smaller, manageable steps.
// Write Pseudo Code: Create a high-level description of the steps in plain language.
// Draw a Flowchart: Visualize the flow of the program using standardized symbols.
// Implement the Solution: Write the actual code based on the pseudo code and flowchart.
// Test and Debug: Run the program with different inputs to ensure it works correctly.


// Flowcharts: Visualizing the Solution üñºÔ∏è

// Flowcharts are a graphical representation of the steps involved in solving a problem. They use different shapes to represent different types of actions or steps:

// Oval (Terminator): Represents the start and end points of the flowchart.
// Rectangle (Process Block): Indicates a process or action step.
// Parallelogram (Input/Output): Used for input and output operations.
// Arrow (Flow Line): Shows the direction of the flow of execution.
// Diamond (Decision Block): Represents decision points where a condition is checked.


// Importance of Flowcharts:

// Clarity: Provides a clear and concise representation of the algorithm.
// Debugging: Makes it easier to identify logical errors and bottlenecks.
// Communication: Helps in explaining the solution to others effectively.
// Pseudo Code: Bridging the Gap Between Logic and Code üìù
// Pseudo code is a plain language description of the steps in an algorithm. It is not actual code but acts as an intermediary step to help you think through the logic before implementation.


// Importance of Pseudo Code:

// Simplifies Coding: Breaks down the logic into smaller steps, making it easier to write the actual code.
// Focus on Logic: Helps focus on the logic without worrying about syntax.
// Documentation: Acts as documentation that explains how the code works.
// Example: Solving a Simple Problem
// Let's say we want to solve a problem where we need to find the sum of the first 10 natural numbers.

// Pseudo Code:
// Start
// Initialize sum to 0
// For each number from 1 to 10:
// Add the number to sum
// Print sum
// End
// Flowchart:
// Start (Oval)
// Initialize sum to 0 (Rectangle)
// For each number from 1 to 10 (Rectangle)
// Add the number to sum (Rectangle)
// Print sum (Parallelogram)
// End (Oval)
// Key Takeaways:
// Structured Approach: Following a structured approach helps in solving problems efficiently.
// Visualization: Flowcharts provide a visual representation, making complex logic easier to understand.
// Simplified Coding: Pseudo code simplifies the coding process by focusing on the logic.
